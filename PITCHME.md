### What is metadata?

- a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.
- Can classify into separate types
- administrative
- structural
- descriptive

---
### Metadata at ESS


- Scientific data is complex
- Different experiments give different data
- Not always predictable what is important
- Most scientific data is unFAIR
- Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible


---

### Currently metadata can be stored

- In filename (run1_vanadium) - not scalable
- In Excel files - not accessible
- Not at all

---

### Using a data catalogue

- One source of information
- All data can be found through this
- Manages permissions, publication
- User reads a publication, can get data from catalogue

---

### SciCat


- Manage the meta data of raw and derived data which is taken at
experiment facilities
- Meta data
- administrative : data management lifecycle, ownership, filecatalog
- scientific: describing the sample, beamline and experiment
parameters relevant for the users data analysis
---

### SciCat
- Enables management of the lifecycle of the data from creation ,
data analysis and eventual deletion
- Data can be linked to proposals and samples
- Data can be linked to publications (DOI, PID)
- Data can be migrated to and from longterm storage on tape

---

### SciCat
- Helps keeping track of data provenance (i.e. the steps leading to
the final results)
- Allows to check scientific integrity (checksum of data)
- Allows to find data based on the meta data (your own data and
other peoples public data)
- In the long term:help to automate standardized analysis workflow
